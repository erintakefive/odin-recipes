# Recipe Site Project

A recipe website made using HTML following instruction from The Odin Project. Created HTML boilerplate, used tags for formatting, attributes for security and accessibility and used git for version control.

Users can navigate to different recipes, back home and to external sites through absolute and relative links. Images are located within the website's file structure.
